I watch the paint slowly harden. I stare intently at it. For hours and hours. Day after day. I watch it. I must see it dry. I don't really care why I must watch it. I watch it anyway. It pays well. I could watch something else. Maybe use my body instead of just sitting and staring all day. But then we'd be apart. And I don't want that. So I'll keep watching. I'd rather watch paint dry with you. Watching paint ain't so bad when we do it together. Chatting while watching makes the watching better.

But, I know our time is limited. One day, one of us will watch something else. Our time will end. Would it be less special if we knew when it would end? Don't be sad it's over, be happy it ever happened. Let me know if you manage that. I worry I won't find someone else to watch the paint with. But I don't really want to find someone else. The temporalness is tiring. We say we'll stay in touch, but I know we won't. Time passes, I get used to watching without you. It gets harder to remember what it used to be like. I grasp for our memories as I watch alone.
