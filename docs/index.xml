      <description>Let’s put ourselves in the shoes of a CircleCI customer. Probably a trusty pair of Birkenstocks. They login and they’re greeted with a “Dashboard” which looks a little something like this:
I’m going to dissect this page, feel free to open up https://app.circleci.com as your own user if that’s easier to follow. Let&amp;rsquo;s hone in on a section of this page:
To the left of the word “Dashboard” is a sort of, broken mirror icon.</description>

      <description>I specifically stated that I wouldn’t do this. I stated that if I wrote about this, then I’d consider my goal of “writing things” a failure. This was supposed to be technical blog damn it! Well, I figure goals are like rules. Sometimes you gotta bend ‘em and sometimes you gotta break ‘em. Plus, now I get to write about the fuzzy line between addiction and obsession and how to waste your life.</description>

      <description>Thankfully I’ve never had a long distance romantic relationship. I imagine Zoom isn’t really up to the task of replacing snuggles. A hug emoji isn’t a hug. This had led me to believe that any kind of long distance relationship was inferior to a short distance one. I was wrong.
How could I bond with my colleagues to any meaningful degree if I couldn’t fist bump them after they deployed a new feature and say “ayyy that was lit fam”?</description>

      <description>I’m not really much of a goal setter. I don’t make new years resolutions. I don’t have a budget, I don’t track my workouts and I don’t keep a journal. There’s a quote “What gets measured gets managed” and I don’t measure anything at all. In school I didn’t even like using a ruler. My lines were all wonky and my bar charts made people shriek. But they were still lines and they still worked.</description>
